Overview
========
Intel Multi-Buffer Crypto for IPsec Library is highly-optimized
software implementations of the core cryptographic processing for IPsec,
which provides industry-leading performance on a range of Intel(R) Processors.

For information on how to build and use this library, see the
Intel White Paper:
"Fast Multi-buffer IPsec Implementations on Intel Architecture Processors".
Jim Guilford, Sean Gulley, et. al.

The easiest way to find it is to search the Internet for the title and
Intel White Paper.
